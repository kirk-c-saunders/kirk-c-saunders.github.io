                <p>This project provides a set of self-contained SQL Scripts designed to hide/mask senstive data in a SQL Database
                    allowing a team to store production realistic data sets in lower environments without breaking data compliance laws
                    because the data is hidden/maked into a different value with no way to restore it to it's previous value.

                <p> This project holds a set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to run a simple round of the classic
                    family game show, "Family Feud". Plans are to upgrade this project in the future to allow it to
                    generate a round on demand from either a database on an API as well as track team scores.
                    Allowing this to be used as a tool to support family game nights or similar fun events in small groups.

                <p>An HTML page with a list of HTML/CSS/JavaScript vocabulary words important for us students to know.
                    Has some CSS applied to it to make it slightly more interesting to look at while reviewing the list.
